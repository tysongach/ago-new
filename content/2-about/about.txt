Title: About

----

Story: Our chapter was chartered on January 17, 1938 and is now comprised of over 180 members. We are a diverse group of capable, energetic and enthusiastic persons: organists, choir directors, organ builders, technicians, clergy, students, and others. We represent all levels of playing proficiency, and are also very appreciative of those who simply listen and support organ and choral concertsâ€¦
